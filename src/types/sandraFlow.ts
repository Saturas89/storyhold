// Types for the Sandra-First "compose-your-own-question" flow.
//
// Sandra is the tech-savvier buyer who lands on `#/ask`, composes 2–10 personal
// questions in her own words, and sends them to a relative (Ingrid, the
// recipient) via the existing pack-code share mechanism. The resulting pack is
// the same question-pack shape used elsewhere in the app, only with a handful
// of optional metadata fields so the receiver side can detect and adapt.
